            What started as a simple idea from Emily Kleinfelter (Bike This
            City) on a Thanksgiving social ride in 2024 hosted by Z Cycle turned
            into the ultimate celebration of the city&apos;s vibrant bicycle
            community. Denver Bike Fest is all about celebrating community,
            connection, and the joy of getting around on two wheels. The
            festival brings together local community groups, nonprofits, and
            businesses to showcase their efforts to get more people on bikes.
            Featuring live music, food trucks, and beer all sourced locally,
            Denver Bikes Fest is all about supporting and building community.
            Our first-ever Denver Bike Fest on April 26, 2025 at City Park
            Pavilion was a huge success — over 2,000 people came out to connect,
            learn, and party!

                  Bike This City is Emily Kleinfelter, a transportation planner,
                  road safety professional, and community organizer who believes
                  bikes can transform how we experience our community. She

                  connect people to Denver’s bike community, shares real-life

                  matter for all of us. Bike This City leads the organizing and
                  outreach efforts behind Denver Bike Fest.
